# Pacman Game

This repository contains a classic implementation of the Pacman game built using Java. The project simulates the famous arcade game where Pacman navigates a maze, collecting dots, avoiding ghosts, and achieving high scores. The game is built with object-oriented programming principles and allows for a dynamic gaming experience with randomized mazes and ghost behavior.

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay:** Play as Pacman, navigating the maze, eating dots, and avoiding ghosts.
- **Dynamic Maze Generation:** The maze layout is dynamically generated based on user input and predefined letter files, creating unique game experiences.
- **Ghost AI:** Ghosts with basic AI behavior chase Pacman, providing an engaging challenge.
- **Score Tracking:** The game tracks the player's score, displaying it on the screen and updating as dots are collected.
- **Collision Detection:** Proper collision detection between Pacman and walls, dots, and ghosts.
- **User Input:** Allows users to control Pacmanâ€™s movement with keyboard inputs.
