## Introduction

Pacman is one of the most iconic arcade games of all time. This project aims to recreate the classic Pacman experience with modern development practices. The game is built using [insert technologies/languages used, e.g., Python, Pygame, JavaScript, etc.], making it accessible for developers of all skill levels to understand, modify, and extend.

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay**: Enjoy the traditional Pacman experience with ghosts, pellets, and power-ups.
- **Customizable Levels**: Easily modify or create new levels by editing the level files.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your high score as you progress through the game.
- **Responsive Controls**: Smooth and intuitive controls for an optimal gaming experience.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Play the game on Windows, macOS, or Linux.

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TeymurkhanliNurhan/Pacman.git
   cd Pacman
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - If the project uses Python and Pygame:
     ```bash
     pip install pygame
     ```
   - For other dependencies, refer to the `requirements.txt` file or the documentation.

3. **Run the Game**:
   - For Python-based projects:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
   - For other languages, follow the specific instructions in the repository.

## How to Play

- Use the **arrow keys** (or specified controls) to move Pacman around the maze.
- Collect all the pellets to advance to the next level.
